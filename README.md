# School-View

This is the GitHub repository for the New Town High School School View web application.
It is combining old technologies to make a new technology: we are combining street view with a unique way of conveyning information. 
Really, it's nothing fancy: it's a school assignment, and we're developing slowly - no one on the project has created a web app with HTML, CSS and JavaScript before.
We're deploying this on GitHub Pages, so have a look: https://frlegg.github.io/School-View

Someone else is deciding to use our idea, but without the animations and with PHP. His repository is here: https://github.com/epikgamer696969/school-website It's far better, and we envy his work.
